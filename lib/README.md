# Adding lib Folder to IntelliJ
Apologies for adding an extra bit of hassle but it 
ain't too bad. 

1. Click file
2. Click "Project Structure"
3. Go to the "Modules" section
4. Select the "Dependencies" tab
5. There will be a little '+' button either above or below this section. 
Click that shit.
   
6. There will be an "add Jar/Directory" option, 
click this and then choose the "lib" folder.
   
7. Done. If we ever need to add any more
external libraries etc in the future we just throw
   them in this folder and it should be all good. 
   

# Adding lib Folder to Eclipse
There's always one. 

1. Install IntelliJ (nah jkin). I copied the following
from stack overflow bc i don't have eclipse:


    2. Create a folder called lib in your project folder.
    3. copy to this folder all the jar files you need.
    4. Refresh your project in eclipse.
    5. Select all the jar files, then right click on one of 
       them and select Build Path -> Add to Build Path
